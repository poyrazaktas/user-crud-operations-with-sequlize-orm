## Introduction

This project was my homework on my internship application. I used Node.js while developing the back-end of this project and the Angular framework while developing the front-end. Also, while I was developing the front-end I created some custom CSS and used Bootstrap 5 and Toastr.
I started the project by creating the back-end with Express.js. After creating the database with the Sequelize ORM, I started to create a user interface by design requirements. I also continued to develop the back-end parallel to these developments. 

## 1. Backend

Run these following commands:

```shell
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

## 2. Frontend

Run these following commands:

```shell
cd client
npm install
ng serve --open
```
